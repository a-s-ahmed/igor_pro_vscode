# igortest1 README

Currently a work in progress, igor.tmLanguage is based on https://github.com/byte-physics/language-igor and is being re-packaged for vscode default themes, both dark and light. Im testing with Light (Visual Studio), Light+ (defualt light), Dark (Visual Studio), Dark+ (defualt dark) but I also tried creating a custom theme pack.

 After a couple of days of working on that as I realized I can avoid making the user download a second add-on and instead code with the default theme packs in mind. Will update when most features are added, and then focus on fixing bugs.
